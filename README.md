The maze is 20 * 20.

Press `ESCAPE` to return to menu.\
At any moment, press `c` to change the colors.\
`h` gives you help in-game (when in menu).\
`s` to shuffle the screen (in menu).\

## Graphics

The colors are inverted where things are drawn on screen.\
This makes text hard to read, but gives things this unique style.\
You can see shapes thanks to their motion and your persistance of vision.\
(Not sure if it's this effect)
